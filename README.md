# Components

### A Modern Angular Bootcamp project

[View the demo](https://components-two-roan.vercel.app/)

This components application was developed as part of a [Modern Angular Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-modern-angular-bootcamp) project. I finished working on this project in February 2024.

**Some of the concepts that form part of this project:**
- Lazy Loading
- Reusable Components
- Angular Routing<br>

I developed multiple pages, each featuring a series of reusable components. I relied upon Semantic UI for some styling and re-implemented some interactions using Angular.
